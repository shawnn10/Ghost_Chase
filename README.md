# "Ghost Chase"

A Love2D Horror Block Game
"Can you escape?"

## Description

"Ghost Chase" is my first game developed in Lua using the Love2D framework as part of my CS50x course. This project has been a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to combine programming skills with game design to create something fun and engaging.

The game is a simple yet thrilling single-level horror game where players must escape from a ghostly blue block that relentlessly chases them. The goal is to collect four keys scattered throughout the map to unlock doors and secure your escape. If the ghost touches you, the game ends.

To enhance the experience, I’ve included a few exciting features:

Dynamic overlays that add a sense of drama and tension as you play.
Fully functional keys that open doors, making exploration and strategy essential.
Challenging gameplay mechanics, where careful navigation and quick reflexes are vital for survival.
While the concept is straightforward, creating "Ghost Chase" has taught me a lot about programming logic, event handling, and designing engaging player experiences. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

## Getting Started

There are two main ways to set up and play the game, depending on your preference.

Path 1: RAW (Source Files)
This path involves playing the game directly using the Love2D engine. It’s ideal for those who want to explore the source files or ensure the code is safe.

Path 2: .EXE (Compiled Version)
This is the intended and easiest way to play. It requires minimal setup and provides the best overall experience.

## Dependencies

To run the game, you will need:

A computer running Windows 10 or higher.
Love2D installed for the RAW path (see instructions below).
Installation

### RAW Path

Follow these steps if you want to play the game using the Love2D engine:

Download the game files:
Head to the game’s GitHub repository: Ghost_Chase.
Download the files as a ZIP archive or clone the repository.
Install Love2D:
Download Love2D from its official website: https://love2d.org/.
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Run the game:
Extract the downloaded game files to a folder.
Drag and drop the entire game folder onto the love.exe file included in the Love2D installation directory.
If you encounter any issues, refer to the video tutorial linked below.

### .EXE Path

This method is faster and more convenient but requires you to trust the precompiled executable.

Download the compiled game from my website [[addercustoms.com](https://sites.google.com/addercustoms.com/home)]:
Visit the game’s website or GitHub repository to download the ZIP file containing the compiled game.
Extract and run:
Unzip the downloaded file.
Double-click the ghostchase.exe file to start playing.

## Gameplay Instructions

Launch the game using your preferred setup method (RAW or .EXE).
Control your character using the keyboard to navigate the haunted office.
Move left/right: Arrow keys currently the only movement option with no othe supported devices.
Interact: simply walk into them and the games collision system will handle it (for doors and keys).
Collect all four keys to unlock the exit door while avoiding the ghost.
Survive long enough to escape the haunted office!

## Features

Dynamic overlays: Adding a layer of suspense to enhance the horror atmosphere.
Key and door mechanics: Keys function as intended, adding strategic depth.
Ghost AI: The ghost dynamically tracks the player, increasing the challenge.
Collision detection so the player is forced to stay in the play area while the ghost can go threw walls

i originaly planed to call this Hunted Office and if you look around you might still find it somewhere in the readme.
chat gpt was used to make this.... chat gpt had interesting design choices like placing the player inside a wall the first time we are going to try to test collisions.
