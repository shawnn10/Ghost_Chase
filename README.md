# "Ghost Chase"

A Love2D Horror Block Game
"Can you escape?"

## Description

"Ghost Chase" is my first game developed in Lua using the Love2D framework as part of my CS50x course. This project has been a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to combine programming skills with game design to create something fun and engaging.

The game is a simple yet thrilling single-level horror platformer where players must escape from a ghostly blue block that relentlessly chases them. The goal is to collect four keys scattered throughout the map to unlock doors and secure your escape. If the ghost touches you, the game ends.

To enhance the experience, I’ve included a few exciting features:

Dynamic overlays that add a sense of drama and tension as you play.
Fully functional keys that open doors, making exploration and strategy essential.
Challenging gameplay mechanics, where careful navigation and quick reflexes are vital for survival.
While the concept is straightforward, creating "Haunted Office" has taught me a lot about programming logic, event handling, and designing engaging player experiences. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

## Getting Started

There are two main ways to set up and play the game, depending on your preference.

Path 1: RAW (Source Files)
This path involves playing the game directly using the Love2D engine. It’s ideal for those who want to explore the source files or ensure the code is safe.

Path 2: .EXE (Compiled Version)
This is the intended and easiest way to play. It requires minimal setup and provides the best overall experience.

## Dependencies

To run the game, you will need:

A computer running Windows 10 or higher.
Love2D installed for the RAW path (see instructions below).
Installation

### RAW Path

### .EXE Path

This method is faster and more convenient but requires you to trust the precompiled executable.
