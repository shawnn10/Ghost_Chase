i used chat gpt for several things in the project per class guidlines. i will make each use with --gpt 
ill be the first to admit its an okay tool but it doesnt realy know what its doing most the time. so even if you see --gpt
i probably spent more time correcting code than asking for help beacuse it was consistently inconsistant
